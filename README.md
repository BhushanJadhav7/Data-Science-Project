# Data-Science-Project
Welcome to my collection of Data Science projects! This repository contains a variety of projects that explore different aspects of Data Science, including but not limited to:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Methods for summarizing, visualizing, and understanding data.
Machine Learning: Supervised and unsupervised models, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Deep Learning: Neural networks and advanced architectures.
Data Visualization: Creating informative and interactive visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and more.
Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and anomaly detection in time-based data.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language models.
